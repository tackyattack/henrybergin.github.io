            This project started when I was watching the Netflix series, Stranger Things. VFX has always been a side hobby of mine so when I saw the 3D creature in the show, I was captured because it looked so cool. At the time it had been awhile since I did some VFX, so this kind of sparked my interest again. Over the next couple days (between the stresses of my classes), I would spare a little brain power to get reacquainted with <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender 3D</a> -- my favorite 3D modeling software that I've been using since I a little kid.
        </p>
        <p>
             Modeling software is always changing, but one thing that's stayed constant is rendering times. They're long. VERY long. Take Toy Story 3 for example: each frame of the film took, on average, 7 hours to render. Sometimes up to 39. That's a long time! Escpecially considering there's 24 frames per second of film. Of course, they have render farms with tons of machines to split up the workload so it doesn't take tens of years. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Obvisouly my VFX work isn't going to be so complex that it takes 7 hours per frame to render, but it's not hard to get up to 30 minutes. This can get extremly frustrating when trying to make small changes because you can't really tell what your work is going to look like until the frame renders. And not only that, but my computer gets so hot that I can burn myself. Which isn't good. So this is where I started to wonder to myself, "could I run my peices through a render farm somehwere so I don't have to deal with this?" Turns out there's a lot of options for offsite rendering, but there's a problem: it costs money. Nope! Not on an option on my college student budget.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I started thinking about my other options, it hit me: there's tons of computers on my campus that are set up for remote log in! Why not distribute my rendering across those? Blender 3D comes with a few plugins to help with distributed rendering, but that quickly became a mess because it was hard to keep track of the virtual machine instances.

            Since it was pretty clear that using the premade tools wasn't feasabile for my setup, my
