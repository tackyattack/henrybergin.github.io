                This project started because I needed a Halloween costume and I had always wanted to incorporate my electronics knowledge into something fun such as this. The idea came from my favorite music duo: Daft Punk. Both of them wear robotic-like costumes when they performed, so naturally this had to be my costume too.

                I picked Thomas' helmet since the shape would be easier to recreate. The base I chose was a baseball helmet because the visor made for a perfect shape to match the real deal. I used a combination of cardboard and shiny air duct tape to follow the design as closely as I could with my shoestring budget.

                After the helmet part was done, I moved on to the electronics. Rather than buying an LED display for the front (expensive and not shaped right), I decided to create my own. First I bought I bunch of cheap red LEDs off of eBay and soldered them into a visor shape. After fitting them, I coated the backs with black enamel paint to make sure no light leaked backwards and blinded me. This was a really good decision because it made it possible to see outward.

                For the controller board, I used a combination of a Microchip PIC development board and a custom LED controller made from daisy chained shift registers. Essentially, the way it works is the PIC shifts in an array of high/low combinations to the register chips, which then ground/source the LEDs in a pixelated pattern. It's fairly simple and allows a lot of control. I multiplex them so only one row is on at a time, but the data rate is high enough that all the pixels appear to be lit. As shown in the video, it cycles through a set of LED "shows" that I modeled after the real helmet.
