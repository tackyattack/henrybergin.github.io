                Self-driving cars have always intrigued me. Over the summer I decided it would be cool to look into how they work. My research quickly led me to want to explore the algorithms that power self-driving cars. I learned a lot about computer vision and how it can be applied to roads, which inspired me to try and design my own system.

                Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to develop a super complex vision system, but I was able to get it to the point where a webcam could detect the edges of a paved road using using the OpenCV C++ library, and figure out the needed path to follow. I built a little GUI and threw it on to a portable computer I had previously made (the tupperware container in the pictures below). Unfortunately, since it is not currently legal to have a self driving car in my state, I had to be the driver. This was alright anyways because my goal was just to see if it could work, and as fun as building a motor-steering wheel system would've been, I simply didn't have the budget for that. Technically speaking that would be the easy part -- it was more of getting the algorithm to work right. So instead, I build in a virtual steering wheel on the GUI (red circle with green directional line) to show where the system would be steering.

                The results were quite good. It was just about spot on with where I was going to steer towards while out on the road. The only thing that confused the program was shadows on the roadway. This was partly due to the fact that the camera was low quality and I hadn't done much to get around shadows other than turn the contrast way down. This is definitely the next thing to improve upon, and there's plenty of research out there on the issue. Shadows will always cause problems, but there's lot of little tricks like shape detection to recognize it. Maybe my next project will be building a cheap laser vision system.
